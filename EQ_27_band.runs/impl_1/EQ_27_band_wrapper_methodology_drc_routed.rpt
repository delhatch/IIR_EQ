There is a large setup violation of -4.130 ns between EQ_27_band_i/eq_core_0/inst/eq_core_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg1_reg[11]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and EQ_27_band_i/eq_core_0/inst/eq_core_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/Lz0_reg[32]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
